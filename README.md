# neuralnet
## Overview
neuralnet is a personal project aimed at implementing neural networks from scratch. This project serves as a learning tool to understand the fundamentals of neural network architectures and operations without relying on high-level libraries.

## Features

- Custom implementation of neural network layers
- Backpropagation algorithm
- Various activation functions
- Basic optimization techniques

## Requirements

- C/C++ compiler (GCC or Clang recommended)
- Make (optional, for build automation)

## Setup

Clone the repository:
Copygit clone https://github.com/Ziyadaj/neuralnet.git
cd neuralnet

Compile the project:
Copymake
Or manually compile if you're not using Make:
Copyg++ -std=c++11 -O2 -Wall main.cpp -o neuralnet

Run the program:
Copy./neuralnet
